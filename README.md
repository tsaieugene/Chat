# Chat

Chat application that allows users to send messages to each other in real-time using Socket.IO.

Instructions:
The dependencies used for this application are all located in the package.json file. Download the files and run “npm install” in the folder of where the files are. This project uses MongoDB, so you will need to run a mongod process in the background. Then start the server with either “npm start” or “nodemon.” Then open localhost: 3000 on the browser. 

You can open multiple browsers at localhost: 3000. Each one will be given a unique socket and you will be able to mimic multiple different users.
